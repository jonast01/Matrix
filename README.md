# Matrix
matrix with given field and corresponding calculation
it can be used to construct a matrix using specified fields
Why i am doing this: 
  1. I don't know how to use gaussian elimination with finite fields on wolfram alpha
  2. the Maths Homeworks are more than just disgusting
  3. I can have some more coding experience by doing this
  4. It helps me to get better grades in Maths
  
The end goal is to be able to calculate everything related to linear algebra.
