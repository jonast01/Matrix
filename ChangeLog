Matrix ChangeLog:

01/25/2020
changed the structure of gaussian elimination and put some useful methods such as 
exchanging rows into basic package named "reforming" under matrix
added functions:
-matrix
  -reforming
    -rows interaction
    -row transformation
coming features: finite field with 2 elements, completing docs of all classes


01/24/2020
start of the project, building everything from scratch
including fuctions:
-field
  -rational numbers
-number test using fields
-matrix
-matrix test using fields and matrix
-gaussian elimination
